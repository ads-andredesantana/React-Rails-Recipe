# Recipe webpage using React

## Ruby on Rails application that stores your favorite recipes then displays them with a React frontend

Website created with React following an online advanced tutorial of Chuks Opia (https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-a-ruby-on-rails-project-with-a-react-frontend). <br />

The main challenges were to integrate React in the Front-End and Rails in the Back-End of the application. Multiple filters were used in this project to select the rooms, such as:

- Create recipes
- Read recipes
- Delete recipes


The project was deployed on Netlify: <br />
